# Breast Cancer Clustering Analysis: Project Overview 
* Utilized a non-probabilistic k-means clustering algorithm to classify observations into either malignant or benign diagnosis
*	Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data from 30 predictor variables to 7, with a tradeoff in reduction in accuracy from 91.2% to 87.0%
*	Determined that breast cancer cells with greater radii, compactness, concavity and symmetry are more likely to be malignant
*	Determined 'mean radius' as the most important/meaningful variable and used Newton's Method to calculate the 95% confidence intervals for the true parameter mean and variance of the population
